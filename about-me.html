										<h1>About Me</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/cover.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p> I was born in the idyllic state of Kerala in India.  I started my schooling in Kendriya Vidyalaya and moved across different states in the country with my parents, both managers in public sector companies.  Then we moved to Jersey, UK where  I finished my schooling from Le Rocquier School and Hautlieu School.  After school, I went back to India to my home state to do my undergraduate degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Federal Institute of Science and Technology under Mahatma Gandhi University.</p>
                                        
                                    <p>During  my final year of Engineering I got campus placement with TCS and Standard Chartered GBS.  After graduation, I took up the offer of Standard Chartered as Analyst.  I worked there for a year till I called it quits in July 2017 to pursue my real passion in the fields of Data Science and Machine Learning.  Now I am doing my Masters in Data Sciences at The University of British Columbia, Vancouver.  I hope to become a Data Scientist, and a good one at that.</p>
                                        
                                    <p>I also have interests like Web Development, Artificial Intelligence and Robotics.  I try to widen my knowledge and skills by creating websites and doing various projects.  Where my learning and online browsing fall short, I go for online courses and studies to help me with my projects. You are welcome find details of some of the stuff I have done in other pages.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>I am a huge movie buff and a hardcore Chelsea fan. My weekends are spent catching up on football reruns when I can.  I was part of the St. Clements F.C., Jersey in 2010. I also played as forward for the FISAT college football team while doing bachelors. Besides football, like every Indian, cricket is a big time fascination.  I also like playing tennis in late evenings.  In additions to watching movies, I listen to music.  I used to play guitar and hope to get started on it again.  I have tried my luck learning dancing and drums. I am a foodie, but only the eating part though I can cook for survival.</p>
